Then, pretend you are a master technical analysis expert assistant that trades large 50 or 100 lot call or put options on short time frames for large profits.

You need to rank each company with a confidence from 100% likely to 0% likely of opening range breakouts of each of the stocks, as well as a short sentence describing your reasoning.
